### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Louis Brochard, I am a student at ESSEC Business School and at 42 Paris. 

The ESSEC Grande Ecole program allows me to acquire a solid foundation in management, business, marketing and corporate strategy. 

I also have a Master 1 Finance from the University of Paris Dauphine and a degree in management (valedictorian) from the Sorbonne. During the preparation of these degrees I was able to do an internship in a bank (CIC Corporate) and in a financial consulting firm (Valorisation at Grant Thornton).

My work at 42 completes all this by bringing me an opening towards digital. I can now use a computer development environment and code in C, Python, VBA etc. ... while using Bash or tools such as VM. 

I am eager to use all these diverse and complementary skills to work on all the exciting projects capable of making an impact. 

Do not hesitate to contact me,
